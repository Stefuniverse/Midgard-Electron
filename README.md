# Midgard Helper App
A collection of features to help GMs to generate complex wildlife and plants in any area at Midgard.

In order to help me with this project, set it up as follows:

2.  Go to your command line, clone the repo, jump in the new folder and type

```
$ npm i

## Usage
1. Chose the contry and the area at the bottom left hand side
2. Click Environment and choose Flora or Fauna and "generate random"
3. More features will follow soon =)
